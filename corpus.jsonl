There are some departments that do deploy it into the field, but of those departments there is almost no data collected about its use. Currently Paramedics are not recognized by insurance companies as health care providers capable of performing ultrasound. If there were more data on the subject that may eventually change. We are hoping to prove that not only is ultrasound useful in an ambulance, but that paramedics are good at interpreting the results. We will save images, the paramedic's diagnosis and some basic information about the call. We will not save any protected health information (PHI) or any information linking the subject to the study. The data collected will be sent to a non-biased ultrasound reviewer to grade the images for the accuracy of diagnosis and the quality of the view obtained.

Pulmonary hypertension is a rare blood vessel disorder of the lung in which the pressure in the pulmonary artery (the blood vessel that leads from the heart to the lungs) rises above normal levels and may become life-threatening.~Normal volunteers and patients with pulmonary hypertension 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. All candidates are screened with a review of their medical records. Normal volunteers also have a medical history, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram (heart ultrasound), and pulmonary function test, in which the subject breathes in and out of a tube that measures lung volume, mechanics and function.~All participants undergo the following tests and procedures:~Echocardiogram to measure heart function and blood pressure in the lungs. A small probe held against the chest uses sound waves to obtain pictures of the heart.~Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the heart's pumping action. Subjects lie on a stretcher that slides into a long, tube-shaped scanner. The machine uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the heart.~6-minute walk to measure how far the subject can walk in 6 minutes. Subjects walk around the hospital for 6 minutes at a comfortable pace.~Exercise testing to measure the ability to exercise and the subject's oxygen levels during exercise. Subjects exercise on a bike or treadmill while the oxygen and carbon dioxide they breathe are measured using a small device placed in the mouth.~Right heart catheterization to measure pressure in the heart and lungs. A small catheter (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein. A longer catheter called a central line is placed in a deeper vein in the neck or just below the neck, or in the leg or arm.

Response to ethanol, on the other hand, has a roughly 80% chance of significant tremor reduction, though daily use of this as a treatment has potentially serious medical, social, and legal consequences.~The leading hypothesis for ET pathophysiology is an unmasking of spontaneous oscillations originating in neurons of the inferior olive.
